## 🛑 Before you start (Requirements)

We are assuming you already deployed a [WordPress website running on Apache (LAMP)](https://4geeks.com/interactive-exercise/deploying-wordpress-site-debian). If you don't please star tby doing so and then you can come back to these next steps on implementing a backup process and best practices.

## 🌱 How to start this project?

Open the computer that contains your WordPress running on Apache and continue with the instructions below.

## 📝 Instructions

### 1. Assemble your team and choose a layout.

Make a python (recommended) or bash script that, when executed, performs the following actions.

- [ ] Perform a backup of the WordPress site files.
- [ ] Perform a database backup associated with the WordPress site.
- [ ] Generate a compressed file with all the backups made.
- [ ] Create a cron job to run this backup daily.
- [ ] Make sure to follow the 3-2-1 Backup Strategy: 3 copies of your data, 2 different storage options, 1 offsite backup.

## 🚛 How to deliver this project?

Once the Python or bash script is ready, upload it to your 4Geeks.com project delivery.
